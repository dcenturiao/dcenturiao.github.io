<br> 

**Hi, welcome to my website!** 👋  

<br> 

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu/), currently in my 5th year and on the **2025–26 job market**. I hold both M.A. and B.S. degrees in Economics, as well as a bachelor degree in Management and certificates in Accounting and University Teaching.  

My professional background spans the private sector, public institutions, and academia, with more than five years of research experience and over two years as an assistant professor at the university level. My research interests lie in **Urban & Regional Economics** and **Public Economics**, particularly focused on the formulation and evaluation of policies and their impacts on economic outcomes across different spatial levels.

## Job Market Paper  

**The effectiveness of speed enforcement policies in congested cities**

Large, congested cities face a persistent dilemma: how to reduce motor vehicle
collisions without worsening congestion. Speed reduction policies such as slow zones,
speed bumps, and automated monitoring systems are designed to enforce lower
driving speeds, yet their spatial effects remain poorly understood. This study presents
an empirical evaluation of speed calming policy effects on traffic outcomes. I estimate
the causal effects of these interventions using New York City as a case study and a
spatial difference in differences design, leveraging daily street-level data on motor
vehicle collisions, injuries, and fatalities. The analysis exploits spatial and temporal
variation in collisions between street segments where each policy was implemented
and comparable untreated segments before and after policy implementation. The
results reveal heterogeneous impacts across policy types. Stricter enforcement via
automated speed cameras is associated with increases in motor vehicle collisions and
injuries in treated areas, with spillover effects that also raise collision rates on nearby
streets. In contrast, moderate enforcement measures such as slow zones and speed
humps show modest, statistically significant reductions in motor vehicle collisions and
injuries, with benefits extending beyond treated segments. No statistically significant
effects are found for fatalities. Using the estimated coefficients and dollar values of
collision costs from the literature, I conduct a cost-benefit analysis showing that slow
neighborhood zones and speed bumps tend to be more cost-effective in improving
traffic safety than automated speed cameras. These findings highlight the importance
of tailoring traffic safety interventions to the urban context and accounting for both
localized and spillover effects when designing policies for congested cities.
