Hi, Welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a 4rd year Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu/), and Graduate Research Assistant of the [Regional Research Institute](https://rri.wvu.edu/). I hold both a M.S. and B.S. degrees also in Economics. Additionally I have a degree in management and a certificate in accounting and university teaching. 

Throughout my career, I have worked in the private and public sector and as a researcher (+5 years) and as a professor (+2 years). My research interests are in empirical and theoretical analyses of economic growth and development at international or regional scales on topics such as infrastructure development, transportation and mobility, governance, institutions and urbanization.

My research has been presented and published in conferences and journals in Latin America, United States and Europe. My most recent working papers can be found on my [SSRN repository](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=6215328).
