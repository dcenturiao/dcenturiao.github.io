## Previous Teaching Experience

I have previous experience as an adjunct professor at both the State University of Mato Grosso do Sul and the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, the largest university in the state with more than 29,000 students. My responsibilities included preparing syllabi, delivering lectures, grading, advising students, and offering office hours. At the State University, I taught in the Geography Department, with courses conducted in Brazilian Portuguese. At the Federal University, I taught Economics and Business courses in the School of Management and Business, as well as Principles of Economics and Business for departments such as Computer Engineering and Chemistry. This double appointment gave me valuable experience teaching diverse audiences across disciplines. Following are the courses that I’ve taught:
